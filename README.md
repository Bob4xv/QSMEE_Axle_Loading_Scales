This project was created for the Queensland Society of Model and Experimental Engineers (QSMEE) 
to provide a facility to measure the load presented by a locomotive axles individually.  This
enables the builders to equalize each axle as required on both 5" and 7 1/4" gauge track.
A facility was added to add each axle to memory giving a total weight of the locomotive.

// QSMEE axle weighing scales by Bob Campbell.
// Using the HX711 ADC SPI module and 12c 7 segment display from ebay.
// Processor is Arduino Uno.
// Libraries used are LedControl-master from git-hub.  https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl
//    and HX711_ADC-master from git-hub. https://github.com/olkal/HX711_ADC & https://github.com/bogde/HX711
//  The load cells are two LC4103-K100 in parallel supporting a track segment.
