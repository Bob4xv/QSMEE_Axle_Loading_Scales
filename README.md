This project was created for the Queensland Society of Model and Experimental Engineers (QSMEE) 
to provide a facility to measure the load presented by a locomotive axles individually.  This
enables the builders of their scale model locomotives to equalize each axle as required on both 
5" and 7 1/4" gauge track.
A facility was added to add each axle to memory giving a total weight of the locomotive.

Hardware requirements:-
Arduino uno processor, HX711 SPI Loadcell ADC, 8 character 7 segment LED I2C display module.
The load cells are two LC4103-K100 in parallel supporting a track segment.

Software requirements:-
Arduino IDE with the following libraries installed. 
	LedControl-master from git-hub.  https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl
	HX711_ADC-master from git-hub. https://github.com/olkal/HX711_ADC & https://github.com/bogde/HX711
